# Python Cab Booking System

Welcome to the Python Cab Booking System! This project implements a simple command-line-based cab booking system where users can book rides, choose cab types, and view ride details. The system is built using Python and provides a simple interface for simulating a cab booking process.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/models**: Contains the models and classes representing the entities in the system, such as the Cab, Customer, and Ride.
- **/services**: Handles the main business logic of the cab booking process (e.g., booking a ride, checking availability).
- **/utils**: Contains utility functions for handling user input, formatting, and other miscellaneous tasks.
- **/tests**: Unit tests for ensuring the system behaves as expected.
- **main.py**: The main entry point of the application that ties everything together.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get the Cab Booking System up and running locally:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
- **pip**: Python's package installer, in case additional dependencies are needed (although this project does not have any external dependencies).
